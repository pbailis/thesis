		  a global scale have been a mystery. Here, we trace such
		  information-spreading processes at a person-by-person level
		  using methods to reconstruct the propagation of massively
		  circulated Internet chain letters. We find that rather than
		  fanning out widely, reaching many people in very few steps
		  according to “small-world” principles, the progress of
		  these chain letters proceeds in a narrow but very deep
		  tree-like pattern, continuing for several hundred steps.
		  This suggests a new and more complex picture for the spread
		  of information through a social network. We describe a
		  probabilistic model based on network clustering and
		  asynchronous response times that produces trees with this
		  characteristic structure on social-network data.},

  abstract	= {Modern storage systems employing quorum replication are
		  often configured to use partial, non-strict quorums. These
		  systems wait only for a subset of their replicas to respond
		  to a request before returning an answer, without
		  guaranteeing that read and write replica sets intersect.
		  While these partial quorum mechanisms provide only basic
		  eventual consistency guarantees, with no limit to the
		  recency of data returned, these configurations are
		  frequently “good enough” for practitioners given their
		  latency benefits. In this work, we discuss why partial
		  quorums are often acceptable in practice by analyzing the
		  staleness of data they return. Extending prior work on
		  strongly consistent probabilistic quorums and using models
		  of Dynamo-style anti-entropy processes, we introduce
		  Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) consistency,
		  which provides expected bounds on staleness with respect to
		  both versions and wall clock time. We derive a closed-form
		  solution for versioned staleness and model real-time
		  staleness for representative Dynamo-style systems under
		  internet-scale production workloads. We quantitatively
		  demonstrate why, in practice, eventually consistent systems
		  employing partial quorums often serve consistent data.}
